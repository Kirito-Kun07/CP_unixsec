These Scripts were Modified and Created by Diego Cruz, Francis Polytechnic High, CA, USA.

These Linux/Ubuntu Security Scripts are seperated in the case that the image gets corrupted, and the 
competitor can easily see what went wrong and fix it.

I would you to go reccommened in the following order if you are using all of them:
Read README
Do Forensic Questions
Harden_Defensive_Countermeasures.sh

However, in the end you can use them in whichever order you want.
Just make sure the scripts don't interfere with the Forensic Questions!!

Enjoy, and Good Luck Future Nationalist!

Intructions to how to run scripts:
chmod +x <script_name>    -Will give execution permissions
./<script_name>		  -Will execute script

Example:
chmod +x main.sh
./main.sh


Extra Notes:
The script known as "The_Last_Stand.sh". As a last chance resort script it contains commands with programs being uninstalled and
configurations that I was unsure would mess the Operating system due to not fully understanding or gut feeling.
Thus I recommend doing this as a last chance to get points if lost, strategy
